## Make It Random

Cut-Up Technique is around for almost hundred years. It is an outstanding tool for searching new ideas. However I haven't seen even one nice digital version of this method. Eeach one lacks something, so I decided to do that, just for my own purposes. If you find it usable and useful â€” Enjoy!
